All source in packages under net.myorb have been authored by me 
over a 50 year career as a software architect.  Exceptions are those
source files with comments noting an original author and source of
download showing also the original source format translated from.

This deployment directory is built to execute using JVM version 8 or 
higher.  Java sources can be found in other GIT-HUB projects listed
under the SPYDRCOM tree.  The new ZIP files being updated here are
up-to-date builds of the class files and Javadocs.  This build is
to be distributed to our current user base on May 1st

Our team is currently looking for directions to take these projects
forward, so contact is welcome thru my e-mail listed below.  We will
respond and listen to requests and we do plan to act on requests that
show high consensus or seem otherwise attractive as new features to
be added

Thank you for your interest
